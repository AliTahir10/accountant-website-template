          <h3>Business Planning</h3>
          <p>Many business plans are written solely to secure external funding. A good business plan will, however, do much more and should provide
            a strong platform for your business – often (and we recommend) without being a massively detailed document. </p>
          
          <p>Season Business consultancy supports you to put strong plans in place, achieve financial goals and address critical resource requirement in the planning process.</p>
          
          <p>We work with clients to help them plan and in most cases write the plan up following delivery of Business Development Workshop (BDWs) held with senior members of your team.</p>

          <h3>Business Strategy</h3>
          <p>Our business Accelerator Programme prompts clients to consider new strategies for the development of their business.</p>
             
          <p>Strategy must be understood, planned and then implemented. It must identify what your business has to do now and in
             the future to be successful and qualify what successful means.  Whilst driven at senior management level, strategy
             must be owned by decision makers throughout your business to be successful. </p>
            
          <p>However, we are also firm believers that development strategy should be fun and have considerable expertise in achieving
             this balance, through use of strategic tools which significantly differentiate your business from others.</p>

          <h3>Change Management</h3>
          <p>Designing for the future is a better bet than designing for now.</p>
             
            <p>Invariably, new strategies involve a process of change which must be handled at the right pace and carefully considered.</p>
            
            <p>We work with our clients to achieve the benefits of change – whether driven through extraordinary growth opportunities, market alignment, investor, merger, acquisition or downsizing.</p>
            
            <p>We take the future seriously and we support our clients to design new organisation and have a wealth of experience in redesigning existing.  Assessing all the elements of an organisation
            and its operating environment and acting to bring them into alignment has given our clients outstanding results, allowing them to continuously perform well.</p>
            
            <p>We do not offer off-the-shelf solutions to drive change. Our approach is collaborative and driven by often constantly evolving challenges which face dynamic, high – performing organisations.</p>

             <p>We are an expert in performance driven change, human capital management, organisational design, communication and project plans. We have seen excellent results from these programmes and will
               be happy to discuss case studies with you upon request.</p>
            
            <p>Our view is that there are clear linkage between strategy, organisational behaviour and the management of change – leadership has to be effective and Season Business will help you achieve this.
            During transition, our consultants are on hand to assess, manage and advice of the infrastructure and systems required for successful business transformation.</p>

          <h3>Project Managament</h3>
          <p> What is a well-run project? </p>

            <p>Projects should fit with business strategy, be clearly defined and bring specific benefits to your business. A well-run project, achieved through strong project management involves planning,
            communications, handling budgets and keeping a balance between the key parameters of time, cost and quality.</p>
           
          <p>What are the key benefits of using a Season Business project manager?</p>

            <p>The project manager is often viewed as a balancing mechanism, being responsible for time, cost and quality.</p>

          <p>Season Business Consultancy project managers will:</p>
  
            <ul>
              <li>Comprehensively plan all elements of the project</li>
              <li>Control cost, quality and effectively</li>
              <li>Control the project thoroughly, gaining the trust and support of colleagues</li>
              <li>Engage the project team in decision making – boosting both productivity and trust</li>
              <li>Structure task in logic and correct order</li>
              <li>Solve problems and contingency plan </li>
              <li>Stay focused on the results</li>
          </ul>
            
          <p>We are able to provide highly capable project managers, available to handle part or full project lifecycles.
          We have experience of successful delivery of large, complex stakeholder projects, although we will project manage
          any business development, change or IT projects whatever the size, particularly where this is the result consultancy
            services provided by Season Business Consultancy.</p>
